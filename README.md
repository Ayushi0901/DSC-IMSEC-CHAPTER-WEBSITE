# DSC-IMSEC-CHAPTER-WEBSITE

<h1>WELCOME TO DSC_IMSEC</h1>
<p>We are building a website for DSC-IMSEC . We are using HTML, CSS ,JS and bootstrap for frontend and Mongodb , Express.js and Nodejs for backend.</p>

<h1> What we are using </h1>
--We are using
  <h2>For Front-end-:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> HTML</li>
  <li> CSS</li>
  <li> JS</li>
  <li> Bootstrap</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> For Back-end-:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> MongoDB</li>
  <li> Nodejs</li>
  <li> Expressjs</li>
  </ul>
 <h1> How to install Mongodb , nodejs and expressjs ?</h1>
  <h2> Installation Steps for nodejs [windows 10]</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Download the Windows installer from Nodejs.org.</li>
  <li>Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)</li>
  <li>Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).</li>
  <li>Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>ALSO REQUIRED-</h3>
  <p>Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.</li>

<li>Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28</li>
<li>Create a test file and run it. A simple way to test that node.js works is to create a simple JavaScript file: name it hello.js, and just add the code console.log('Node is installed!');. To run the code simply open your command line program, navigate to the folder where you save the file and type node hello.js. This will start Node.js and run the code in the hello.js file. You should see the output Node is installed!.</li>
